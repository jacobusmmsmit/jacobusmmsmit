Hello, I'm a Master's student at Oxford, next year I'm joining the
<a href="https://ivi.uva.nl/research/socially-intelligent-artificial-systems-group.html">Socially Intelligent Artificial Systems</a> group at the University of Amsterdam as a PhD student.


* 💻 I'm currently working on
  * 🚶🏿‍♂️ Bayesian calibration of pedestrian models (my dissertation) 
  * 🔺 Efficient Voronoi diagrams on the CPU
  * 📈 Combinatorial Time Series Optimisation (CoTSOpt)
  * 📙 Learning Dutch

- 💬 Ask me about Julia for numerical computing or join the community [here](https://discourse.julialang.org/invites/BC6thrmqZQ) where I, and many others, spend time supporting other Julia members. Much friendlier than StackOverflow :')
- 📜 A few of my repositories are currently private for anonymous marking reasons, I hope to make them public in June to be able to showcase some of my up to date code!
