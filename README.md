Hello, I'm a Master's student at Oxford, next year I'm joining the
<a href="https://ivi.uva.nl/research/socially-intelligent-artificial-systems-group.html">Socially Intelligent Artificial Systems</a> group at the University of Amsterdam as a PhD student.


* 💻 I'm currently working on
  * 🚶🏿‍♂️ Calibration of pedestrian models
  * 🥗 Generalising the MLP-Mixer architecture
  * 📙 Learning Dutch

- 💬 Ask me about Julia for numerical computing or join the community [here](https://discourse.julialang.org/invites/BC6thrmqZQ) where I, and many others, spend time supporting other Julia users. Much friendlier than StackOverflow :')
- 📜 A few of my research repositories are currently private, I hope to make them public as the research develops!
