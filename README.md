Hello, I'm a PhD student at the
<a href="https://ivi.uva.nl/research/socially-intelligent-artificial-systems-group.html">Socially Intelligent Artificial Systems</a> group at the University of Amsterdam.


* 💻 I'm currently working on
  * 🤝 The dynamics of cooperation through [indirect reciprocity](https://github.com/sias-uva/indirect-reciprocity), if you're working on something similar, try my implementation or get in contact with me to see if we can adapt it to your problem,
  * 🚶🏿‍♂️ Calibration of pedestrian models (see [social-force-jax](https://github.com/jacobusmmsmit/social-force-jax)),
  * 🥗 Generalising the MLP-Mixer architecture (see [multimixer](https://github.com/jacobusmmsmit/multimixer)),
  * 🎨 Accelerating Voronoi diagram calculation (see [DiscreteVoronoi.jl](https://github.com/jacobusmmsmit/DiscreteVoronoi.jl)),
  * 📙 Learning Dutch.

- 💬 Ask me about Julia for numerical computing or join the community [here](https://discourse.julialang.org/invites/BC6thrmqZQ) where I, and many others, spend time supporting other Julia users. Much friendlier than StackOverflow :')
- 📝 I also have a blog. I recently wrote a post <a href="https://jacobussmit.com/blogposts/jax-julia-comparison.html">comparing JAX and Julia for numerical/scientific computing</a> and another on <a href="https://forem.julialang.org/jacobusmmsmit/writing-optimised-julia-with-wisdom-from-c-pfj-temp-slug-4569728?preview=84e54102777f4dca084c329f096d93bbaca017a842a47aa3530d5f201f8da66962b67358c7d64cc25d240385c6423c24e171626dc0ea87b2bc0a31b7">applying C++ optimisations to Julia</a> (and how it's not always the right thing to do!).
